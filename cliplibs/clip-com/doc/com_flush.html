 <B>COM_FLUSH()</B>
 Clears the receiving buffer
<HR>
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>COM_FLUSH(&lt;nComPort&gt;) --&gt; lClear</B>

 <B>Argument</B>

     <B>&lt;nComPort&gt;</B>  Designates the port (1 to N) for which the receiving
     buffer is cleared.

 <B>Returns</B>

     If the receiving buffer can be cleared successfully, the function
     returns .T..

 <B>Description</B>

     This function allows you to flush all the characters in a receiving
     buffer.  This makes it unnecessary to tediously determine how many
     characters are currently in the buffer in order to remove them with a
     read procedure.

     COM_FLUSH() guarantees a truly empty buffer.  However, a new character
     can be received between the time that you call a COM_COUNT() and a
     COM_READ().

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>”</B>  A COM_FLUSH() on an unopened port is ineffective.

 <B>Example</B>

     cHayes  :=  "ATZ"           // Hayes modem reset command
     COM_SEND(1, cHayes)         // Issue Hayes command
     INKEY(1)                    // Wait one second
     COM_FLUSH(1)                // Reject modem reply messages
