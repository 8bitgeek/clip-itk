   <p>
   Millions lines of code created with CA-Clipper are waiting for their
   deaths in millions of computers. CA Inc., once having created the best
   means of development, left its developers without support.
   In the absence of progress in CA-Clipper,
   a great number of users now have to turn to other platforms.

   <p> Remaining CA-Clipper adherents, the group of programmers has decided
   to breathe new life into these tools.

   <p> We have decided:

   <ul>

   <li> To create a multiplatform compiler compatible as much as possible with
   the CA-Clipper, and specially for the Linux-UNIX.

   <li> To add the possibilities it had no before and the
   availability of which has long been urgent, particularly X-Window System,
   Embedded & Internal SQL, MultiThreads, and some other things which, for the
   present, we wish not to speak about.

   <li> To try to provide for the maximum compatibility with a dialect
   and the CA-Clipper possibilities, though this is not the main aim,
   and during the appearance of conflicts between compatibility and
   functionality the latter is chosen. Currently, there are some
   incompatibilities, though they are not principal and do not require a
   global revision of the Clipper code. All the incompatibilities can be
   eliminated, using "search and replace" method in a text editor, and
   these sources are easily compiled with CA-Clipper.

   <li> To provide for a smooth move from DOS medium to Unix and the support of
   the peculiarities of national codings in different operational systems.

   <li> We had to allow incompatibility in ïï-model because of its low
   efficiency in CA-Clipper.

</ul>
<p>
P.S. Since we know the Clipper 5.0x dialect best of all, we take this into
account in the first place. But it means no impossibility to achieve
compatibility with later versions. In particular, compatibility with RDD
has been provided.
   Please send us any revealed incompatibilities in the form of short test
   PRG files, and we will try to solve these problems.
